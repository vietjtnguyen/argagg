0.4.7
-----

- Added argagg::convert::parse_next_component()
- Added optional conversion header argagg/convert/csv.hpp
  - Added argagg::csv<T> and a corresponding argument conversion specialization
- Indexing argagg::parser_results with an option name that does not exist now
  throws an argagg::unknown_option instead of not handling the
  std::unordered_map::at() std::out_of_range exception (see issue #20).
- Added explicit unary not operator to argagg::option_result and
  argagg::option_results (see issue #15)
- Added optional conversion header argagg/convert/opencv.hpp
  - Added argument conversion specialization for cv::Point_
  - Added argument conversion specialization for cv::Point3_
  - Added argument conversion specialization for cv::Size_
  - Added argument conversion specialization for cv::Rect_
- Replaced std::endl with \n (#27)
- Replaced fmt fork with word wrap implementation (#21, thanks @myint!)
- Fixed exception reference warnings in test cases (#30, thanks @rianquinn!)
- Fixed minor typos and spelling mistakes
- Fixed -Wsign-conversion warnings (thanks @sschoedel!)
- Added interface target to CMakeLists.txt (thanks @gmes78!)

0.4.6
-----

- Added use of argagg::fmt_ostream in gengetopt_main1 example
- Merged pull request #12
  -  replace static_cast<bool> w/ non-zero comparison to avoid compiler
     warnings on MSVC
- Typo fixes

0.4.5
-----

- Fixed bug in integer and float argument conversion specializations where
  invalid conversions were not being correctly handled. Invalid conversions
  (like "garbage" to float) will now throw an exception. Note though if the
  as<T>(default) overload is used (with a default value specified) then all
  exceptions in the conversion result in the default being returned.
- Changed base exception type for argagg exceptions from std::argument_error to
  std::runtime_error
- Now compiles with -Wpedantic

0.4.4
-----

- Added some minor error handling to argagg::fmt_string()

0.4.3
-----

- Added argagg::fmt_string() to format a string using the fmt program when
  compiling on a __unix__ platform. Degrades to an identity function when not
  on a __unix__ platform.
- Added argagg::fmt_ostream as a convenience stream that will stream the
  formatted string to the referenced final std::ostream when the
  argagg::fmt_ostream destructs
- Fixed bug when compiling with clang where the non-template implicit bool
  operator was being selected when implicitly converting to an integer. By
  making the implicit bool operator a specialization of the templated implicit
  conversion operator the compiler should now select the correct overload.

0.4.2
-----

- Fixed missing inline specifiers on argagg::convert::arg specializations,
  fixes multiple definitions bug

0.4.1
-----

- Fixed compiler errors when using clang with regards to some initialization
  list usage for empty containers and a false positive -Wreturn-stack-address
  treated as an error

0.4.0
-----

- Changed argagg::definition::help and argagg::definition::flags to use
  std::string instead of const char*
- Fixed compilation error with clang

0.3.1
-----

- Updated documentation
- Added greedy processing examples and tests

0.3.0
-----

- Added support for POSIX command line option behaviors
  - Options (short) start with a hyphen (-) and long options start with two
    hyphens (--)
  - Multiple short options can be grouped following a single hyphen
    - -a -b -c can also be written -abc or -bac, etc.
  - Option names are alpha numeric but long options may include hyphens
    - -v is valid, --ftest-coverage is valid
    - -# is not valid, --bad$option is not valid
  - Short options can be provided arguments with or without whitespace
    delimiters
    - -I /usr/local/include and -I/usr/local/include are equally valid
  - Long options can be provided arguments with whitespace or equal sign
    delimiters
    - --output test.txt and --output=test.txt are equivalent
  - Options and positional arguments can be interleaved
  - -- can be specified to treat all following arguments as positional
    arguments (i.e. not options)
- Added option definition validation
  - Checks for malformed flags
  - Checks for duplicate flags
- Added conversion functions for rest of fundamental integer types
- Built in conversion functions now utilize strtol(), strtoll(), strtof(), and
  strtod()
- Added char** argv overload of argagg::parser::parse()
- Removed argagg::optional, options now either receive arguments or they don't
- Added example derived from gengetopt documentation
- Expanded unit test coverage to 98%
- Added coveralls integration for code coverage reports

0.2.2
-----

- Actually tried compiled introduction example code
  - Fixed bugs in the intro example code
  - Added it to test cases
- More detailed comments in the joinargs example
- Separated documentation from devel subpackage into doc subpackage in RPM spec

0.2.1
-----

- Minor documentation fix, listed incorrect exception

0.2.0
-----

- Redesigned API, removed multiple flag args
- Redesigned naming scheme, options instead of flags. Struct names are now
  clearer, realized the "flags" were actually options
  - argagg::flag is now argagg::option_result
  - argagg::flags is now argagg::option_results
  - argagg::result is now argagg::parser_results
		- Renamed args field to pos
  - argagg::flag_spec is now argagg::definition
- Flags can now only have zero, one, or an optional argument
	- Moved argagg::flag_spec::optional to argagg::optional
- Added argagg::option_results which represents multiple flag parse results for
  the parent argagg:definition
- Added implicit boolean conversion for argagg::option_results which represents
  whether or not the parent argagg::definition was found at all
- Added implicit boolean conversion for argagg::option_result which represents
  whether or not that single flag has an argument
- Added implicit type conversions for argagg::flag using the same
  argagg::convert::arg() system
- Updated tests and examples accordingly
- Renamed argagg_joinargs make target to just joinargs
- Removed old Doxygen style.css
- Added option_lacks_argument_error exception class
- Added associated flag to exception error messages

0.1.3
-----

- Fixed file specification for empty parent package

0.1.2
-----

- Fixed documentation installation under RPM building
- Added missing build dependencies from RPM specfile

0.1.1
-----

- Removed gcc color output flag
- Fixed grammar in documentation
- Updated include guard definition name

0.1.0
-----

- Initial version
